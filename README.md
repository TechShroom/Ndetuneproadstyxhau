Ndetuneproadstyxhau
======

Ndetuneproadstyxhau is a Java obfuscation tool. Can't pronounce the name? Neither can we!

### Ok, but what's it do?
It adds a duplicate method with a different return type for each method in a class, making it harder to compile against and de-obfuscate. That's pretty much it.
